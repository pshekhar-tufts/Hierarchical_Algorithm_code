# Hierarchical_Algorithm_code

This repository contains the python code for Algorithm 1 in the paper. Algorithmic implementation is done in Hierarchical_approach.py. The basic learning and prediction is presented in functions Hierarchical_learn_basic and Hierarchical_predict_basic functions respectively.

Please note:

1. Here we just provide the code for the performance on test functions and not Real data. However that is straightforward as the repository contains the code for the algorithm
2. The repository contains Jupyter notebooks with the codes for producing Figure 1 to Figure 8 in the paper.
